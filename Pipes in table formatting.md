There are conflicting statements in docs.github.com pages about whether pipe characters are required at the ends of lines.

## Code

[organizing-information-with-tables](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables) | "The pipes on either end of the table are optional." |
[using-markdown-and-liquid-in-github-docs](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/using-markdown-and-liquid-in-github-docs) | "Every row of a table in the GitHub Docs must start and end with a pipe, `\|`." |
```

## Conclusion

[organizing-information-with-tables](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-tables) is correct, and it's even OK to mix and match formatting approaches within a table.
